Tokaido is an automation platform for Drupal development environments on MacOS, Linux & Windows.

It streamlines the process of creating, managing, saving, and sharing local Drupal projects using Docker.

With Tokaido, you can start new Drupal projects or launch production-grade local environments for existing projects in as little as 5 minutes.

Tokaido provides a useful default configuration that makes it easy to get started, but offers progressively more advanced configuration options for power users.

## Installation

Installation instructions are available on the [Tokaido website](https://docs.tokaido.io/en/docs/installation)

## Features

- Drupal 7 and 8 Support.
- Runs on MacOS.
- Easy to use! Just type `tok up` for a zero-configuration environment.
- Fast! Most environments are ready in less than 30 seconds.
- Highly configurable with an easy to use config editor (`tok config`)
- Production-grade environments with Varnish and HAProxy included.
- Easily add services like Mailhog, Solr, PHP Adminer, Xdebug, and more
- Commercial support available

## Why switch to Tokaido?

Tokaido was built out of frustration with how much time Drupal developers spend
trying to manage their local development environments. While other great tools
like DrupalVM and Lando have made it easier and easier for developers to build
repeatable Drupal environments, we felt there was still a lot of room for
improvement.

With Tokaido, we have shifted towards a more opinionated Drupal environment
setup and coupled it with the same containers that we (Ironstar) run in
enterprise Drupal hosting environments.

So what makes Tokaido better?

- Using Docker instead of Vagrant enables faster, more light-weight environments
- The powerful `tok` CLI streamlines your set up and helps keep you out of config files
- Tokaido's inbuilt proxy enables verified SSL connections to your environment
- We run Tokaido in production, so your local environment can be production-grade
- Built-in Varnish caching enables production-like testing of your code

## The Tokaido CLI
Tokaido also ships with an incredibly powerful CLI that helps to eliminate the need for you to manually manage config files:

\* Docker4Drupal is controlled by a Docker Compose file and requires an indepth
understanding of Docker and Docker Compose.

\+ Lando provides a helpful CLI that makes starting and managing environments
easier, but we still think Tokaido and DDev have it beat in this department.

\+\+ Really just a docker-compose exec command, which is helpful for running commands
but is not a full-featured dev environment

\*\* Nearly every Drupal project we've tested works with Tokaido without any
special config. When testing Lando and Docker4Drupal, even the most basic Drupal
minimal installation required special config to get going.
